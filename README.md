# Polynomials

## Summary

A file for implementing polynomial functions.

## Implementation

### Polynome
The implementation of the polynomial is straightforward - from a list of coefficients

## Functionalities

- Defining an object of type Polynome;
- Value and getters;
- Evaluating the polynomial for a given value, calculating derivative, antiderivative and definitive integral, solving for the roots and taking the limit for x -> +-inf;
- Representations of the polynomial, as well as a show function, which writes out the polynomial as a mathematical function;
- Operations with other polynomes, such as composition, addition, subtraction, multiplication, whole division and true division (with the remainder).

## Not supported

- Polynomials of more than 1 variables.
- Graphs with loops (a link, both ends of which are the same node).
